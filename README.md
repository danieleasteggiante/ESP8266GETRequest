# ESP8266GETRequest
Library in c for Arduino that allows to send basic commands from Arduino to ESP8266 01 by SoftwareSerial Ports
this works on Arduino and with the ESP8266 not flashed and with AT Commands firmwares:

AT version:1.2.0.0(Jul  1 2016 20:04:45)
SDK version:1.5.4.1(39cb9a32)

maybe also with another but I have tried only with this one.

Thank you!
